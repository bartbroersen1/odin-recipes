    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta Bolognese, also known as Spaghetti Bolognese, is a classic Italian pasta dish beloved worldwide for its hearty and rich flavors. At its core, it consists of al dente pasta, commonly spaghetti or fettuccine, served with a savory meat-based sauce. The sauce is traditionally made with ground beef or a mixture of ground meats such as pork and veal, cooked with aromatic ingredients like onions, garlic, carrots, and celery. Tomatoes and tomato paste are added for a robust tomato flavor, and the sauce is simmered slowly, allowing the flavors to meld together. A splash of red wine and a touch of cream can also be included for extra depth and creaminess. The result is a luscious, meaty sauce that clings to the pasta, creating a satisfying and comforting meal, often garnished with freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese and chopped fresh herbs like basil or parsley.</p>
    <p>Pasta Bolognese is a timeless comfort food that beautifully balances the tender pasta with the bold, savory meat sauce. Its versatility allows for various pasta shapes and accompaniments, making it a staple in Italian cuisine enjoyed by people of all ages. Whether homemade or savored at an Italian restaurant, Pasta Bolognese is a dish that never goes out of style, offering a warm and satisfying taste of Italy's culinary heritage.</p>
